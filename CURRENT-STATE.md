# AI Receptionist - Current State & Progress
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-17
**Status:** üü° In Development - Voice Quality Improvement Phase

---

## üéØ Current Goal
Make the AI receptionist sound **exactly like a real human** in natural conversation before implementing business-specific features.

---

## ‚úÖ What's Working

### Core Functionality
- ‚úÖ **Call routing works** - Twilio ‚Üí Railway ‚Üí OpenAI Realtime API
- ‚úÖ **AI responds** - No more radio silence
- ‚úÖ **Basic conversation** - Can have multi-turn conversations
- ‚úÖ **Webhook stability** - Fixed duplicate CallSid crashes

### Technical Stack
```
Phone Call (Twilio)
  ‚Üì
Railway Backend (Node.js/Express/WebSocket)
  ‚Üì
OpenAI Realtime API (gpt-realtime model)
  ‚Üì
Direct audio-to-audio conversation
```

## üîß Recent Major Fixes (Oct 17, 2025)

### 1. Database Constraint Fix
**Problem:** Webhook crashed on duplicate CallSid
**Solution:** Changed `prisma.call.create()` to `upsert()` to handle Twilio retries gracefully
**Commit:** `5401f2c`

### 2. Continuous Conversation Flow
**Problem:** Felt like rigid turn-taking, not natural flow
**Solution:**
- Adjusted VAD settings (threshold 0.3, silence 400ms)
- Added backchanneling instructions (mm-hmm, yeah, right)
- Allowed AI to interject naturally while user speaks
- Dynamic energy matching

**Commit:** `e052e85`

### 3. Intelligent Interruption Detection
**Problem:** AI stopped dead when user made ANY sound (including "yeah", "mhm")
**Solution:** 800ms smart detection
- User speech < 800ms ‚Üí Backchanneling, AI continues
- User speech > 800ms ‚Üí Real interruption, AI stops
- Preserves natural overlapping conversation

**Commit:** `adbde92`

### 4. Voice & Personality Overhaul
**Problem:** Sounded robotic, too crisp/formal/clear, wrong voice (male)
**Solution:**
- Voice: verse ‚Üí **shimmer** (soft, warm female)
- Temperature: 0.8 ‚Üí **0.9** (more variation)
- Personality: Casual 30-year-old woman
- Anti-robotic instructions: vocal fry, breaths, imperfect delivery
- Explicitly told NOT to sound like news anchor/customer service

**Commits:** `7fac160`, `0a33df8`, `4587bf0`

## üìä Current Configuration

### Voice Settings
```javascript
VOICE: 'shimmer'           // Soft, warm, natural female
TEMPERATURE: 0.9           // High variation for naturalness
MODEL: 'gpt-realtime'      // OpenAI's production voice model
```

### VAD (Voice Activity Detection)
```javascript
threshold: 0.3             // Sensitive to natural pauses
prefix_padding_ms: 200     // Quick response
silence_duration_ms: 400   // Balanced timing
create_response: true      // Auto-respond after silence
```

### Interruption Handling
```javascript
Backchanneling detection: 800ms
- Speech < 800ms ‚Üí AI continues (backchanneling)
- Speech > 800ms ‚Üí AI stops (interruption)
```

### Personality
- **Identity:** 30-year-old woman named Alex
- **Vibe:** Casual phone conversation with friend
- **Energy:** Relaxed, chill, low-key (not peppy/formal)
- **Delivery:** Imperfect, natural, with vocal texture
- **Anti-patterns:** NOT news anchor, customer service, audiobook narrator

---

## üî¥ Known Issues (In Progress)

### Voice Quality
**Status:** Improving but not perfect yet

Issues:
- Still sounds somewhat robotic
- Too clear/crisp (not human-textured enough)
- Needs more natural imperfections

**Next Steps:**
- Continue iterating on voice instructions
- May try alternative voices (nova, ballad, ash)
- Fine-tune prosody instructions

### Interruption Handling
**Status:** Functional but could be smoother

Current behavior:
- 800ms delay works for backchanneling
- Real interruptions are detected
- Could feel more natural with further tuning

## üìÅ Key Files

### Backend
```
apps/backend/src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ websocket/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ realtime-handler.js    # OpenAI WebSocket, VAD, interruption logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ routes/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ realtime-call.js        # Webhook, TwiML, prompt instructions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ server.js                   # Express app, route registration
```

### Configuration
```
apps/backend/.env               # API keys, database URL
```

### Deployment
```
Railway:                        # Auto-deploys from main branch
  - Health: https://ai-receptionistbackend-production.up.railway.app/health
  - Webhook: /api/realtime/incoming
Twilio:                         # +1 877-357-8556
  - Webhook points to Railway
```

## üéØ Development Workflow

### Local Testing
1. Start backend: `cd apps/backend && node src/server.js`
2. Start ngrok: `ngrok http 3000`
3. Update webhook: `node apps/backend/update-webhook-to-local.js`
4. Call and watch logs in real-time

### Production Deployment
1. Commit changes: `git add -A && git commit -m "..."`
2. Push to GitHub: `git push origin main`
3. Railway auto-deploys (watch uptime for fresh deployment)
4. Webhook already points to Railway

## üìù Conversation Instructions (Summary)

### Voice Delivery
- Natural intonation with pitch variation
- Emotional expression (happy, surprised, thoughtful)
- Vocal fry at end of phrases (natural for women)
- Breaths, sighs, laughs mid-sentence
- Sometimes trail off or restart sentences
- Voice has texture/warmth, not crystal clarity

### Conversation Flow
- Continuous, not turn-based
- Use backchanneling (mm-hmm, yeah, right, wow)
- React in real-time while user is speaking
- Match user's energy dynamically
- Sometimes single-word reactions ("Totally!", "Really?")

### Language Style
- Use contractions (I'm, you're, that's)
- Casual words (yeah, cool, totally, for sure)
- Natural filler words (um, like, you know)
- VARY responses (no robotic repetition)
- Keep most responses 1-2 sentences

### What to Avoid
- Formal language ("I apologize", "I understand your concern")
- Customer service phrases ("How may I assist you?")
- Long monologues
- Overly enunciated speech
- Robotic repetition

## üìû Test Number
**+1 877-357-8556**

Call this number to test the current state. Listen for:
- Female voice (shimmer)
- Casual delivery
- Natural backchanneling when you say "yeah", "mhm"
- Can interrupt with full sentences after 800ms
- Should feel like talking to a real person (improving)

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Database Schema

Uses PostgreSQL (Supabase) with multi-tenant architecture:
- **Business** - Each business has its own AI receptionist
- **BusinessConfig** - AI personality, voice, hours, services
- **Call** - Complete call logs with transcripts
- **Customer** - CRM for tracking callers
- **Appointment** - Scheduled appointments
- **Message** - Messages taken by AI
- **Payment** - Payment tracking (Stripe integration planned)

---

## üí° Architecture Decisions

### Why OpenAI Realtime API?
- Direct audio-to-audio (no STT ‚Üí GPT ‚Üí TTS pipeline)
- Preserves emotion, tone, natural flow
- Sub-500ms latency
- Natural interruption handling built-in
- Can laugh, sigh, switch tone naturally

### Why Twilio?
- Industry-standard phone infrastructure
- Media Streams for WebSocket audio
- Reliable, scalable
- Easy webhook integration

### Why Railway?
- Auto-deploys from GitHub
- Built-in PostgreSQL
- Environment variable management
- Simple, fast deployment
