# Next Steps - Deployment Complete

## ‚úÖ Completed
1. Both dashboards deployed to Netlify successfully
2. Login credentials visible on both login pages
3. Valid user accounts created in database:
   - **Business Dashboard**: bob@bobshvac.com / test123
   - **Admin Dashboard**: admin@voxi.ai / admin123

## üîó Live URLs
- **Business Dashboard**: https://buizdash.netlify.app
- **Admin Dashboard**: https://adzdash.netlify.app

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Update Backend CORS (Required for Login to Work)

You need to add the Netlify URLs to your Railway backend environment variables:

### How to Update Railway Environment Variables:

1. Go to Railway dashboard: https://railway.app
2. Select your `ai-receptionist-backend` project
3. Go to **Variables** tab
4. Add/update these variables:

```
ADMIN_DASHBOARD_URL=https://adzdash.netlify.app
BUSINESS_DASHBOARD_URL=https://buizdash.netlify.app
```

5. Railway will automatically redeploy with the new CORS settings

### Alternative: Update Directly via CLI

```bash
railway login
railway variables --set ADMIN_DASHBOARD_URL=https://adzdash.netlify.app
railway variables --set BUSINESS_DASHBOARD_URL=https://buizdash.netlify.app
```

## üß™ Testing After CORS Update

Once Railway redeploys with the new environment variables:

### Test Business Dashboard
1. Go to https://buizdash.netlify.app
2. Use credentials displayed at bottom:
   - Email: bob@bobshvac.com
   - Password: test123
3. Should successfully login and see dashboard

### Test Admin Dashboard
1. Go to https://adzdash.netlify.app
2. Use credentials displayed at bottom:
   - Email: admin@voxi.ai
   - Password: admin123
3. Should successfully login and see admin panel

## üîç If Login Still Fails

Check browser console for errors:
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for CORS errors or API connection errors
4. Common issues:
   - CORS error = Backend environment variables not updated
   - 401 Unauthorized = Wrong credentials (unlikely, they're in DB)
   - Network error = Backend might be down on Railway

## üìã After Login Works - Next Tests

1. **Phone Number Search** (Business Dashboard)
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Phone tab
   - Search for available numbers
   - Test purchase flow (Twilio sandbox)

2. **Make Test Call**
   - Call the assigned Twilio number
   - Test AI receptionist answers
   - Check call logs appear in dashboard

3. **Admin Functions** (Admin Dashboard)
   - View all businesses
   - Check usage analytics
   - Test admin controls
