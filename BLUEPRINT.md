# AI Receptionist - Master Blueprint
**Last Updated:** October 17, 2025
**Current Phase:** Building Human-Like Voice (CRITICAL - Must achieve before proceeding)

---

## üéØ PRIMARY MISSION

**Build an AI receptionist that sounds EXACTLY like a real human and has natural conversations.**

**Success Criteria:** 90%+ of callers cannot distinguish it from a real person.

**CRITICAL:** Until we achieve human-like voice quality, we cannot proceed with ANY other features.

---

## üèÜ THE WINNING ARCHITECTURE

After extensive research of top companies (Vapi, Retell, ElevenLabs), here's what the best use:

```
Phone Call (Twilio)
    ‚Üì
ElevenLabs Conversational AI (WebSocket)
    ‚Üì
Direct audio-to-audio conversation with human-like voice
```

### Why ElevenLabs Conversational AI?

**Voice Quality (#1 Reason):**
- Industry-leading: "Almost indistinguishable from a real person"
- Users report 97% humanized voice quality
- 8 out of 10 people can't tell it's AI
- Natural emotional expressiveness, breaths, pauses, sighs

**Built for Real-Time Phone Conversations:**
- Sub-100ms latency
- Natural turn-taking (understands when to speak like a human)
- Perfect interruption handling
- Built-in backchanneling (yeah, mm-hmm, etc.)

**Customization:**
- 5000+ voices available
- Voice cloning for brand consistency
- Adjustable tone, pacing, style
- Easy to create 3 preview voices for clients

**Enterprise-Ready:**
- Direct Twilio integration (official partnership)
- Proven for phone systems
- Enterprise-grade reliability

**Cost:** ~$0.30-0.50/minute (similar to alternatives but WAY better voice)

## üéôÔ∏è VOICE STRATEGY

### 3 Premium Voice Options for Clients

1. **Professional Female** - "Sarah"
   - Warm, friendly, professional
   - Perfect for: HVAC, plumbing, general service businesses
   - Voice ID: TBD (will test multiple)

2. **Professional Male** - "Charlie"
   - Confident, reassuring, professional
   - Perfect for: Tech, consulting, B2B businesses

## üõ†Ô∏è TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Current Stack
```
Frontend: React (Admin + Business Dashboards)
Backend: Node.js + Express
Database: PostgreSQL (Supabase)
Phone: Twilio
AI Voice: ElevenLabs Conversational AI ‚Üê THE KEY COMPONENT
Deployment: Railway (auto-deploy from GitHub)
```

### Integration Architecture

**Twilio ‚Üí ElevenLabs Flow:**
```javascript
1. Incoming call hits Twilio webhook
2. Twilio returns TwiML with WebSocket connection
3. Backend establishes WebSocket to ElevenLabs Agent
4. Audio streams bidirectionally:
   - Twilio sends caller audio ‚Üí Backend ‚Üí ElevenLabs
   - ElevenLabs sends AI audio ‚Üí Backend ‚Üí Twilio
5. Real-time conversation with sub-100ms latency
```

**Key Implementation Files:**
- `/apps/backend/src/routes/calls.js` - Webhook handler
- `/apps/backend/src/websocket/elevenlabs-handler.js` - WebSocket proxy (NEW)
- `/apps/backend/src/services/elevenlabs.service.js` - ElevenLabs API wrapper

## üîë KEY PRINCIPLES

### 1. Voice Quality is EVERYTHING
- Humans judge AI by voice first, functionality second
- A perfectly functional bot with robotic voice = failure
- A slightly imperfect bot with human voice = success

### 2. Natural Conversation Flow
- Turn-taking must feel natural (not rigid back-and-forth)
- Interruptions should work like human conversations
- Backchanneling (yeah, mm-hmm) must not disrupt flow
- Pauses and timing must feel human

### 3. Emotional Intelligence
- Voice must convey appropriate emotion
- Match caller's energy (excited ‚Üî calm)
- Express empathy when needed
- Sound genuinely helpful, not scripted

### 4. Test with REAL Users
- Internal testing is not enough
- Need external users who don't know it's AI
- 90% pass rate is the minimum bar
- Continuously iterate based on feedback

## üìû CURRENT SYSTEM STATUS

### What's Working
- ‚úÖ Twilio phone integration
- ‚úÖ Database schema (multi-tenant ready)
- ‚úÖ Basic call routing
- ‚úÖ Dashboard frontend (needs backend connection)
- ‚úÖ ElevenLabs API key configured

### What's NOT Working
- ‚ùå Voice quality - currently using OpenAI Realtime (not human enough)
- ‚ùå Static/audio issues with current implementation
- ‚ùå Greeting sounds unnatural
- ‚ùå Active listening (yeah/mhm) causes problems

### What Needs to Be Built
1. **ElevenLabs Conversational AI integration** (TOP PRIORITY)
2. Voice selection and preview system
3. Conversation testing framework
4. Human pass rate measurement system

---

## üéØ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

1. **Implement ElevenLabs Conversational AI**
   - Set up WebSocket handler
   - Connect Twilio ‚Üí ElevenLabs
   - Test basic conversation flow

2. **Test Voice Options**
   - Test 10-15 voices from ElevenLabs library
   - Select best 3 for different use cases
   - Record preview clips

3. **Validate Human-Like Quality**
   - Test with 20+ external users
   - Measure how many think it's human
   - Iterate until 90%+ pass rate

4. **ONLY THEN** proceed to business features

## üöß TECHNICAL DEBT & KNOWN ISSUES

### Current Issues
1. **OpenAI Realtime API** - Voice quality not good enough (switching to ElevenLabs)
2. **Static audio** - Need to revert recent changes
3. **Greeting logic** - Too complex, needs simplification
4. **Active listening** - Breaks conversation flow

### To Be Addressed
- All issues will be resolved with ElevenLabs implementation
- Fresh start with proven best-in-class architecture

---

## üìö REFERENCE ARCHITECTURE

### Similar Products
- Vapi.ai - $0.05-0.10/min, good but uses external TTS
- Retell AI - $0.04-0.08/min, similar to Vapi
- ElevenLabs Direct - Best voice quality, built-in conversation AI

### Best Practices
- Use ElevenLabs for voice (industry consensus)
- Sub-100ms latency required
- Natural turn-taking model essential
- Voice cloning for brand consistency
- Multiple voice options for clients

---

## üéì LESSONS LEARNED

1. **Voice quality can't be fixed with prompting**
   - No amount of prompt engineering makes OpenAI voices sound human
   - Need best-in-class TTS from the start

2. **Simple is better for greetings**
   - "Hello!" beats any complex introduction
   - Let conversation flow naturally

3. **Test with external users early**
   - Internal testing creates bias
   - Real users immediately spot AI voice

4. **Architecture matters more than features**
   - Better to have 1 feature that works perfectly
   - Than 10 features with robotic voice

---

## üîÑ CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

### Testing Protocol
1. Record sample calls weekly
2. External user testing monthly
3. A/B test voice options
4. Iterate on conversation prompts
5. Monitor call completion rates

### Voice Evolution
- Stay updated on latest ElevenLabs models
- Test new voices as they're released
- Consider voice cloning for specific brands
- Optimize for specific industries

---

**Remember: We cannot proceed past Phase 1 until the voice sounds genuinely human. This is THE foundation. Everything else is secondary.**
