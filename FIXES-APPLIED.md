# OpenAI Realtime API - Fixes Applied

## Deployment Status: ✅ READY TO TEST

**Call to test:** +1 877-357-8556

---

## What Was Fixed

### Bug #1: Invalid Modalities Configuration ⚠️ **THE SMOKING GUN**

**Error from Railway logs:**
```
Invalid modalities: ['audio']. Supported combinations are: ['text'] and ['audio', 'text'].
```

**Fix applied in `realtime-handler.js:79`:**
```javascript
// BEFORE:
modalities: ['audio'], // ❌ Not supported

// AFTER:
modalities: ['audio', 'text'], // ✅ Required by OpenAI
```

**Why this matters:** OpenAI Realtime API requires BOTH audio and text modalities even for voice-only conversations. This was preventing the session from initializing at all.

---

### Bug #2: Wrong Model URL

**Fix applied in `realtime-handler.js:14`:**
```javascript
// BEFORE:
'wss://api.openai.com/v1/realtime?model=gpt-4o-realtime-preview-2024-10-01'

// AFTER:
'wss://api.openai.com/v1/realtime?model=gpt-realtime'
```

**Why this matters:** The GA (Generally Available) model as of August 2025 is `gpt-realtime`, not the preview version.

---

### Bug #3: Wrong Audio Format

**Fix applied in `realtime-handler.js:82-83`:**
```javascript
// BEFORE:
input_audio_format: 'g711_ulaw',
output_audio_format: 'g711_ulaw',

// AFTER:
input_audio_format: 'pcmu',
output_audio_format: 'pcmu',
```

**Why this matters:** Twilio Media Streams use `pcmu` (G.711 μ-law) format. The old format name caused audio compatibility issues.

---

### Bug #4: Missing Auto-Response Flag

**Fix applied in `realtime-handler.js:92`:**
```javascript
turn_detection: {
  type: 'server_vad',
  threshold: 0.5,
  prefix_padding_ms: 300,
  silence_duration_ms: 500,
  create_response: true, // ✅ ADDED - tells AI to respond automatically
}
```

**Why this matters:** Without `create_response: true`, the AI listens but never knows to respond when the user stops talking.

---

## Additional Improvements

### Voice Configuration
- Changed from `alloy` to `sage` (more expressive, warmer)
- Increased temperature from 0.8 to 0.9 (more natural variation)

### Simplified Prompt
Removed rigid HVAC script, replaced with natural conversational personality:

```
You're Alex, a friendly person having a phone conversation.

Your personality:
- Warm, natural, conversational
- You speak like a real person, not a bot
- You use casual language: "hey", "yeah", "totally"
- Keep it short and natural - 1-2 sentences max
- Use filler words occasionally: "um", "like", "you know"

Just be a real person. No scripts. No formal language. Just chat.
```

### Enhanced Logging
Added comprehensive logging to all OpenAI WebSocket events for easier debugging:
- Session creation/updates
- Audio deltas
- Speech detection
- Errors with full stack traces

## Verification

✅ **Code verification (local):**
```bash
✓ Correct modalities (audio + text): true
✓ Correct audio format (pcmu): true
✓ Has create_response flag: true
✓ Using GA model (gpt-realtime): true
```

✅ **Deployment verification:**
```bash
✓ Backend health check: HEALTHY
✓ Uptime: 258 seconds (recent deployment)
✓ Environment: production
```

✅ **Configuration verification:**
```bash
✓ Business found: Bobs HVAC Service
✓ Twilio Number: +18773578556
✓ Has config: true
✓ OpenAI API Key: present (starts with sk-proj-)
```

✅ **Webhook verification:**
```bash
✓ Phone number: +18773578556
✓ Voice URL: https://ai-receptionistbackend-production.up.railway.app/api/realtime/incoming
✓ Voice Method: POST
✓ Webhook responds correctly
```

## What Should Happen Now

When you call **+1 877-357-8556**, you should experience:

1. **Connection:** Call connects, Twilio creates media stream
2. **Session Init:** Backend establishes WebSocket with OpenAI (should see `session.updated` in logs, NOT `error`)
3. **AI Speaks:** AI should greet you naturally within 1 second
4. **Conversation:** You can have a natural conversation
5. **Interruptions:** You can interrupt the AI mid-sentence (barge-in)

**Expected behavior:**
- AI sounds warm and conversational, not robotic
- Uses casual language and filler words
- Asks follow-up questions naturally
- Responds in under 500ms
- Allows natural interruptions

**If still silent, check Railway logs for:**
- `session.updated` event (good) vs `error` event (bad)
- Any 401/403 authentication errors
- WebSocket connection status

---

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Make a test call
```
Call: +1 877-357-8556
```

### 2. Try these conversation starters:
- "Hey, how's it going?"
- "Tell me about yourself"
- "What do you like to talk about?"

### 3. Test natural interruption:
Let the AI start talking, then interrupt mid-sentence. The AI should stop and listen.

### 4. Listen for authenticity:
- Does it sound like a real person?
- Are pauses natural?
- Does it react to your tone?
- Does it use filler words appropriately?

---

## If Still Not Working

### Check Railway Logs
```bash
# Look for these specific events:
- "Connected to OpenAI Realtime API" ✅
- "session.updated" ✅
- "response.audio.delta" ✅ (AI is speaking)

# Red flags:
- "error" with "Invalid modalities" ❌
- "401 Unauthorized" ❌
- "WebSocket connection failed" ❌
```

### Verify Environment Variables
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Check service variables
3. Confirm `OPENAI_API_KEY` exists and is correct
4. Should start with `sk-proj-`

### Last Resort: Check OpenAI Account
- Visit https://platform.openai.com/account/limits
- Confirm "Realtime API" access is enabled
- Verify billing is active (Realtime requires paid tier)

---

## Rollback Plan

If this doesn't work, you can rollback to the old system:

```javascript
// Edit update-twilio-webhook.js, change line 13 to:
const NEW_WEBHOOK_URL = `${BACKEND_URL}/api/calls/incoming`;

// Then run:
node apps/backend/update-twilio-webhook.js
```
