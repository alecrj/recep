## ðŸ”¨ What's Left (5%)

**What to do**: Apply premium React template (TailwindUI, etc.)
**Priority**: Medium (not needed for testing)

### 2. Appointment Reminders Cron Job (30 minutes)
**Current state**: SMS reminder function exists, just needs scheduler
**What to do**: Add cron job to send 24hr reminders
**Priority**: Low (can add later)

### 3. API Key Management UI (1 hour)
**Current state**: Missing
**What to do**: Let enterprise clients use their own API keys
**Priority**: Low (most clients use your shared keys)

### 4. Production Deployment (2-3 hours)
**Current state**: Works locally
**What to do**: Deploy to Railway/Heroku/DigitalOcean
