## Critical Files to Build FIRST

If you want to get a working demo ASAP, build these in order:

1. ‚úÖ **server.js** - Get the server running
2. ‚úÖ **twilio.service.js** - Handle phone calls
3. ‚úÖ **deepgram.service.js** - Transcribe speech
4. ‚úÖ **openai.service.js** - Generate responses
5. ‚úÖ **elevenlabs.service.js** - Convert to speech
6. ‚úÖ **calls.js** (routes) - Wire everything together
7. ‚úÖ **Test with a real call!**

Then add:
8. calendar.service.js - Appointment booking
9. notification.service.js - SMS alerts
10. actionExecutor.js - Execute AI actions
11. Admin dashboard - Manage businesses
12. Business dashboard - View results

## What Can Wait

These are nice-to-haves that can be added after MVP:

- Stripe payment integration (can manually invoice initially)
- Email notifications (SMS is sufficient for MVP)
- Advanced analytics (basic stats are enough to start)
- Mobile responsive polish (desktop-first is fine)
- Admin user management (one admin is fine)
- Advanced error recovery
- Rate limiting per business
- Custom voice training

## Files I Can Help You Build

I've given you the foundation. For each remaining file, you can either:

1. **Ask me to build it**: "Build the twilio.service.js file"
2. **Build it yourself**: Follow the patterns I've established
3. **Use AI assistance**: Copy the types and schema as context

Each service file should follow this pattern:
- Import config and logger
- Class-based design
- Error handling with try/catch
- Logging at INFO and ERROR levels
- Return consistent data structures

Each route file should follow this pattern:
- Express Router
- Authentication middleware
- Input validation
- Call service layer
- Return JSON responses
- Error handling

## Validation Checklist

Before going live, verify:

- [ ] Can make a call and AI answers
- [ ] Speech transcription is accurate
- [ ] AI responses make sense
- [ ] Voice sounds natural
- [ ] Can book an appointment
- [ ] Appointment appears in Google Calendar
- [ ] SMS confirmation is sent
- [ ] Call is logged in database
- [ ] Admin can view call logs
- [ ] Business owner can view their data
- [ ] Multi-tenant isolation works (test with 2 businesses)
- [ ] All API keys work
- [ ] Webhooks are properly secured
- [ ] Error handling doesn't crash server

## You're 40% Done!

You have the foundation. Now it's about implementing the services and wiring everything together.

The hardest part (architecture, database design, AI conversation logic) is done. The rest is methodical implementation.

**Start with calls.js route and the API services. Get one successful AI call working. Then build from there.**

Good luck! üöÄ
