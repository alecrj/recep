## üìû WHAT A REAL HVAC RECEPTIONIST DOES (Our Blueprint)

### **Call Flow Scenarios**

#### **Scenario 1: Emergency Call (15% of calls)**
**Customer**: "My heater stopped working and it's 20 degrees outside!"

**Real Receptionist Does:**
1. **Immediate empathy**: "Oh no, that's terrible, especially in this cold!"
2. **Triage urgency**: "Do you have any heat at all? Any gas smell?"
3. **Get basics fast**: Name, phone, address
4. **Check for immediate danger**: Gas, CO, flooding, extreme temps
5. **Either**:
   - Transfer to on-call tech immediately: "Let me get you to our emergency tech right now"
   - OR book emergency same-day: "I can get someone there in 2 hours"
6. **Confirm contact**: "I'm texting you the tech's number now"
7. **Set expectations**: "He'll call you in 5 minutes to confirm"

#### **Scenario 2: Standard Service Call (60% of calls)**
**Customer**: "My AC isn't cooling very well"

**Real Receptionist Does:**
1. **Friendly greeting**: "Thanks for calling Bob's HVAC! This is Sarah, how can I help?"
2. **Let them explain**: Don't interrupt, let them describe the problem
3. **Ask clarifying questions**:
   - "When did you first notice this?"
   - "Is it blowing air at all?"
   - "Have you changed the filter recently?"
4. **Get customer info** (conversationally, not like a form):
   - "What's your name?" ‚Üí "Got it, and the best number for you?"
   - "What's the address where the unit is?"
5. **Check availability**: "Let me see what I have... I've got tomorrow afternoon around 2, does that work?"
6. **Alternative if needed**: "If you need it sooner, I have Thursday morning at 9?"
7. **Confirm details**: "Perfect, so I've got you down for Friday at 2pm for AC not cooling"
8. **Set expectations**: "The tech will call 30 minutes before arriving"
9. **Mention pricing**: "Service call is $89, then if you need repairs the tech will give you a price before starting"
10. **Send confirmation**: "I'm texting you a confirmation right now"

#### **Scenario 3: Pricing/Quote Call (10% of calls)**
**Customer**: "How much for a new AC unit?"

**Real Receptionist Does:**
1. **Don't give exact prices**: "Great question! It really depends on the size of your home and what system you need"
2. **Give ranges**: "Typically we see anywhere from $3,500 to $12,000 depending on the system"
3. **Offer free estimate**: "But the best thing is to have someone come out and give you a free quote. When works for you?"
4. **Book appointment**: Same process as Scenario 2
5. **Explain process**: "Tech will measure your space, check your ducts, and give you a few options with exact prices"

#### **Scenario 4: Existing Customer Callback (10% of calls)**
**Customer**: "Hi, I'm calling back about my appointment"

**Real Receptionist Does:**
1. **Look up customer**: "Sure! What's your name?" ‚Üí Search system
2. **Pull up their info**: "Okay I see you, John Smith, appointment Friday at 2?"
3. **Handle request**:
   - **Reschedule**: "No problem, what works better for you?"
   - **Cancel**: "I can cancel that for you. Is everything okay with the AC now?"
   - **Add info**: "Let me add that note for the tech"
   - **Question**: Answer based on their upcoming appointment

#### **Scenario 5: Wrong Number / Not Service Area (5% of calls)**
**Customer**: "Do you service Orlando?"

**Real Receptionist Does:**
1. **Polite**: "We're actually based in Phoenix, so Orlando's outside our area"
2. **Helpful**: "But I'd recommend calling [local company if known] or searching 'HVAC Orlando'"
3. **Thank them**: "Sorry we couldn't help, but thanks for calling!"

## üé¨ DEMO SCRIPT (For Selling)

**"I'm going to show you something that's going to change how you handle phone calls..."**

[Call the AI receptionist on speakerphone]

**You**: "Hi, my AC stopped working"

**AI**: "Oh no, AC's out? That's the worst. Let me get you taken care of. What's your name?"

**You**: "John Smith"

**AI**: "Perfect. And the best number for you?"

**You**: "555-1234"

**AI**: "Got it. And where are you at?"

**You**: "123 Main Street"

**AI**: "We can get someone out this afternoon at 2pm, does that work?"

**You**: "Perfect"

**AI**: "Great! You're all set for AC repair today at 2pm. You'll get a confirmation text."

[Show them the appointment in their dashboard]

**"That was an AI. Not a person. And here's the appointment, customer profile created, ready for your tech. No missed calls, no voicemail, no call-backs needed. Just handled."**

**"This is $299 a month. Way less than a receptionist, works 24/7, never calls in sick."**

**"Want to try it?"**
