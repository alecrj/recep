[Call the AI receptionist on speakerphone]

**You**: "Hi, my AC stopped working"

**AI**: "Oh no, AC's out? That's the worst. Let me get you taken care of. What's your name?"

**You**: "John Smith"

**AI**: "Perfect. And the best number for you?"

**You**: "555-1234"

**AI**: "Got it. And where are you at?"

**You**: "123 Main Street"

**AI**: "We can get someone out this afternoon at 2pm, does that work?"

**You**: "Perfect"

**AI**: "Great! You're all set for AC repair today at 2pm. You'll get a confirmation text."

[Show them the appointment in their dashboard]

**"That was an AI. Not a person. And here's the appointment, customer profile created, ready for your tech. No missed calls, no voicemail, no call-backs needed. Just handled."**
