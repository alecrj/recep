## Project Philosophy

### Always Remember:
1. **Production-first**: Build it right, no shortcuts
2. **Customer-specific**: Each business gets personalized AI with their details
3. **Database-driven**: Zero code changes per customer, everything configurable
4. **Emergency routing**: Critical feature - routes urgent calls to their on-call tech
5. **Undeniable quality**: Voice quality, latency, natural conversation matter

### When Building Features:
- **Voice quality > Speed**: Better to take time and get it perfect
- **Multi-tenant always**: Never build single-tenant solutions
- **Company branding**: AI must know company address, service area, brands, hours, etc.
- **Emergency handling**: Life-threatening situations must route to humans immediately
