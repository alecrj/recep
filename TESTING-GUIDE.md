## üß™ Step-by-Step Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Create Admin Account

**Open your browser and go to Admin Dashboard:**
```
http://localhost:5173
```

Or use curl to create admin account:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/admin/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "admin@test.com",
    "password": "admin123",
    "name": "Test Admin",
    "role": "ADMIN"
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "admin": {
    "id": "...",
    "email": "admin@test.com",
    "name": "Test Admin"
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Login as Admin

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/admin/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "admin@test.com",
    "password": "admin123"
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "admin": {
    "id": "...",
    "email": "admin@test.com",
    "name": "Test Admin"
  }
}
```

**SAVE THE TOKEN** - You'll need it for next steps!

### Step 3: Create a Business (HVAC Example)

Replace `YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN` with the token from Step 2:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/businesses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Bob'\''s HVAC Service",
    "industry": "hvac",
    "ownerEmail": "bob@hvac.com",
    "ownerName": "Bob Smith",
    "ownerPhone": "+15555551234",
    "password": "bob123"
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "business": {
    "id": "...",
    "name": "Bob's HVAC Service",
    "industry": "hvac",
    "ownerEmail": "bob@hvac.com",
    "status": "ACTIVE"
  },
  "message": "Business created successfully"
}
```

### Step 4: Login as Business Owner

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/business/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "bob@hvac.com",
    "password": "bob123"
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "business": {
    "id": "...",
    "name": "Bob's HVAC Service",
    "industry": "hvac"
  }
}
```

**SAVE THIS TOKEN** - This is the business owner's token!

### Step 5: Apply HVAC Template (Instant Setup!)

Replace `BUSINESS_TOKEN` with the token from Step 4:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/business/config/apply-template \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer BUSINESS_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "industry": "hvac"
  }'
```

**This auto-configures:**
- ‚úÖ 7 HVAC services with realistic price ranges
- ‚úÖ Emergency keywords (no heat, carbon monoxide, etc.)
- ‚úÖ 5 pre-written FAQs
- ‚úÖ Business hours (8am-6pm weekdays)
- ‚úÖ Professional greeting message

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "config": {
    "industry": "hvac",
    "greetingMessage": "Thank you for calling Bob's HVAC Service...",
    "services": [
      {
        "name": "AC Repair",
        "priceMin": 150,
        "priceMax": 500,
        "duration": 90,
        "emergency": true
      },
      // ... 6 more services
    ],
    "emergencyKeywords": ["emergency", "urgent", "no heat", ...],
    "faqs": [...]
  },
  "message": "hvac template applied successfully"
}
```

### Step 6: View Analytics

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/business/analytics \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer BUSINESS_TOKEN"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "analytics": {
    "totalCalls": 0,
    "callsByOutcome": [],
    "conversionRate": "0.0",
    "avgCallDuration": 0,
    "peakHours": [],
    "estimatedRevenue": 0,
    "roi": {
      "appointmentsBooked": 0,
      "estimatedRevenue": 0,
      "aiCost": 1500,
      "receptionistCost": 3500,
      "netSavings": 2000
    }
