**Your pitch:**
*"I have an AI receptionist that costs $1,500/month instead of $3,500, works 24/7, never misses calls, books appointments instantly, and saves you $2,000/month. Want to see it?"*

Then show them:
1. Create their business (30 seconds)
2. Apply HVAC template (instant)
3. Show analytics with ROI ($2,000 savings)
4. Walk through call scenario
5. "I can have this live in 5 minutes"
