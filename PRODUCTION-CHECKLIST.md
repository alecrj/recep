### SQL Queries to Verify:
```sql
-- Check recent calls
SELECT * FROM calls ORDER BY started_at DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Check appointments
SELECT * FROM appointments ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Check customers
SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```

## âœ… Phase 6: Multi-Business Test

### Setup Second Business
1. Run setup script again with different:
   - Business name
   - Twilio number (you'll need to buy another)
   - Different service area
   - Different hours

2. **Test Call Routing**:
   - Call Business A's number â†’ Should get Business A's info
   - Call Business B's number â†’ Should get Business B's info
   - Verify AI uses correct company name, address, hours

---

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### If calls don't connect:
1. Check Railway logs: `railway logs`
2. Check Twilio debugger: https://console.twilio.com/monitor/logs/debugger
3. Verify webhook URL is correct
4. Check DATABASE_URL is set in Railway env vars

### If AI doesn't respond naturally:
1. Check OPENAI_API_KEY is valid
2. Review conversation in database transcript
3. Check `openai.service.js` buildSystemPrompt method

### If appointments aren't created:
1. Check Prisma connection
2. Verify businessId exists
3. Check actionExecutor.js logs

## ðŸ”¥ DEMO SCRIPT FOR SALES

When showing this to a prospect:

### Script:
"Let me show you how this works. I'm going to call your new AI receptionist right now..."

[Call the number on speakerphone]

**You**: "Hi, my air conditioner stopped working and it's 95 degrees in here!"

**AI**: "Oh no, AC's out? That's the worst. Okay, let me get you taken care of. What's your name?"

**You**: "John Smith"

**AI**: "Perfect. And the best number for you?"

**You**: "555-1234"

**AI**: "Got it. And where are you at?"

**You**: "123 Main Street"

**AI**: "Alright, so we can get someone out there this afternoon around 2pm, does that work?"

**You**: "Yes!"

**AI**: "Perfect, we've got you scheduled for AC repair today at 2pm. You'll get a confirmation text shortly. Is there anything else I can help with?"

**You**: "Nope, that's it!"

**AI**: "Great, we'll see you this afternoon!"

[End call, show them the appointment in the dashboard]

**You**: "And just like that, the appointment is in your system, customer profile created, and they got a professional experience. No missed calls, no voicemail, no waiting for a call back. Just handled."
