# ðŸ§ª Local Testing Environment - ACTIVE

## Current Setup

âœ… **Backend running locally on port 3000**
âœ… **Ngrok tunnel active:** `https://leonore-dizzied-out.ngrok-free.dev`
âœ… **Twilio webhook updated to local server**
âœ… **Real-time logging enabled**

---

## How to Test

### 1. Call the number:
```
ðŸ“ž +1 877-357-8556
```

### 2. Watch for logs in real-time
The backend terminal will show EVERY event:
- Incoming call webhook
- WebSocket connection
- OpenAI session initialization
- Audio streaming
- AI responses
- Any errors

---

## What I'm Monitoring

1. **Does the call webhook trigger?** â†’ Should see "Realtime incoming call"
2. **Does WebSocket connect?** â†’ Should see "WebSocket connection for Realtime API"
3. **Does OpenAI session initialize?** â†’ Should see "session.updated" NOT "error"
4. **Does audio flow?** â†’ Should see "input_audio_buffer.append"
5. **Does AI respond?** â†’ Should see "response.audio.delta"

---

## Next Steps

Once you call:
1. I'll see the exact error in real-time
2. Fix it immediately
3. Test again (no need to redeploy)
4. Iterate until perfect
5. Then deploy final version to Railway

## Ready for your call!

**Call +1 877-357-8556 now and I'll see exactly what's happening.**
